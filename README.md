# SharkGame
shark game

This game portrays a shark and a fish swimming around the ocean. Once they crash, the fish changes from orange to blue, making it seem like the shark "ate" it.
They stay in the picture, bouncing off of the screen's edges. Once they crash, the shark will bite down, switching the color of the fish and making a "bump" sound.
The creatures also stay facing the direction they are headed, making the game more realistic.
